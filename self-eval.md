# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

I felt decent about these challenges. It took me quite sometime to find a direction and work with it, but once I understood more about oop with some additional learning, I was able to easily incorporate what I have used what I have learned previously and incorporate it.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
My workflow is going well. I found that if I get stuck, it really helps me to step away and take a short break.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

I need to review what I have learned in module 0 and try to master how to use what I have learned in order to be ready to learn new material.
